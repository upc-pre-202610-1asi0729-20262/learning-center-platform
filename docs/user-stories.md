# Learning Center Platform — REST API Technical Stories

## Overview
This document contains API-focused technical stories intended for frontend or mobile developers integrating with the Learning Center Platform REST API (Java, Spring Boot).

Common conventions
- Base path: `/api/v1`
- All request and response bodies use `Content-Type: application/json`
- All protected endpoints require a JWT Bearer token in the `Authorization` header (see TS-ARCH001)
- Error responses follow a standard schema (see TS-ARCH002)

---

### TS-ARCH001 — Authenticate API Requests with a JWT Bearer Token
As a frontend developer, I want to include the JWT token in my API requests so that I can access protected endpoints after signing in.

Note: Only `/api/v1/authentication/sign-in` and `/api/v1/authentication/sign-up` are publicly accessible without a token. All other endpoints require authentication.

Acceptance criteria:
- Scenario: Authenticated request succeeds
  - Given the client received a token via `POST /api/v1/authentication/sign-in`
  - When the client sends any request to a protected endpoint with the header `Authorization: Bearer <token>`
  - Then the API processes the request normally and responds with the expected resource.
- Scenario: Missing token
  - Given the client sends a request to a protected endpoint without an `Authorization` header
  - When the API detects no token
  - Then the API responds `401 Unauthorized` with no further body.
- Scenario: Expired or invalid token
  - Given the client sends a request with a malformed or expired `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header
  - When the API fails to validate the token
  - Then the API responds `401 Unauthorized` with no further body.

---

### TS-ARCH002 — Handle Standardized API Error Responses
As a frontend developer, I want all API error responses to follow a consistent schema so that I can implement a single, reusable error-handling layer in my application.

Acceptance criteria:
- Scenario: Any error response
  - Given any API request results in an error (4xx or 5xx)
  - Then the API returns a JSON body with the following attributes:
    - `code` (String, required) — machine-readable error code (e.g., `VALIDATION_ERROR`, `COURSE_NOT_FOUND`)
    - `message` (String, required) — human-readable description of the error
    - `details` (String, optional) — additional context, such as the specific field or reason

Error code to HTTP status mapping:

| `code` value                             | HTTP Status                 | Typical cause                     |
|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| `VALIDATION_ERROR`                       | `400 Bad Request`           | Missing or invalid request field  |
| `*_NOT_FOUND` (e.g., `COURSE_NOT_FOUND`) | `404 Not Found`             | Resource does not exist           |
| `*_CONFLICT` (e.g., `USER_CONFLICT`)     | `409 Conflict`              | Duplicate or conflicting resource |
| `BUSINESS_RULE_VIOLATION`                | `422 Unprocessable Entity`  | Operation violates a domain rule  |
| `UNEXPECTED_ERROR`                       | `500 Internal Server Error` | Unhandled server-side failure     |

Example error response body:
```json
{
  "code": "VALIDATION_ERROR",
  "message": "Validation failed",
  "details": "Field firstName: is required"
}
```

---

### TS-ARCH003 — Request Localized Error Messages
As a frontend developer, I want to receive error messages in my users' language so that I can display them directly without additional translation.

Supported locales: `en` (English, default), `es` (Spanish)

Acceptance criteria:
- Scenario: Default locale (English)
  - Given the client sends a request without an `Accept-Language` header (or with `Accept-Language: en`)
  - When the API returns an error response
  - Then the `message` field is in English (e.g., `"Resource not found"`)
- Scenario: Spanish locale
  - Given the client sends a request with the header `Accept-Language: es`
  - When the API returns an error response
  - Then the `message` field is in Spanish (e.g., `"Recurso no encontrado"`)
- Scenario: Unsupported locale falls back to English
  - Given the client sends a request with an unsupported `Accept-Language` value (e.g., `fr`)
  - When the API returns an error response
  - Then the `message` field is returned in English.

Note: Only the `message` field in error responses is localized. All resource data fields (course titles, names, etc.) are stored and returned as provided by the client.
